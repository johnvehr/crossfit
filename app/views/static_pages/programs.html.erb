  <h2>Group Classes</h2>
  <p>
    CrossFit is a constantly evolving strength and conditioning program that is scaled to the fitness level of each individual.  CrossFit takes a unique approach to fitness.  CrossFit 704 is not a typical 24-hour gym in which clients go in and out and work out on their own.  Instead the program is delivered through group classes.  Members come in during scheduled group classes that last 1 hour including a warm-up, “WOD” (workout of the day), and cool-down.  All classes are run by professionals that are at minimum CrossFit Level 1 (CF-L1) trainers.<br><br>
We offer personal training in a community-driven group setting designed to be both competitive and encouraging.  Our workouts constantly vary and incorporate functional movements – movements that make you better at the things you do in everyday life.  Workouts are done at high intensity to guarantee results.  In addition to fitness training we offer knowledge and guidance on nutrition and lifestyle further boost results.
The CrossFit community as a whole understands there is no quick fix to living a healthy and active lifestyle.  If it were that easy, everyone would be fit, ripped, and disease free.  Any program that promises an easy solution to getting you in the best shape of your life is lying to you.  We promise we will get you into the best shape of your life, but we also promise it won’t be easy.  Like all good things, you get out what you put in.

<h2>Foundations</h2>
<p>
  For those of you that are new to CrossFit we ask that you first complete the Foundations program prior to membership.  This program consists of 3 one-hour sessions per week for 4 weeks.  Each session we will briefly discuss important CrossFit topics such as terminology, technique, and nutrition.  We will also learn/train new movements and culminate the session with a group workout.  The goal of the program is to prepare you to safely execute CrossFit workouts during our regular group classes, as well as answer any questions you might have with regards to this unique fitness program.

<h2>Personal Training</h2>
<p>
  In our Personal Training program we offer 1-on-1 or 1-on-2+ training that focuses 100% on your goals.  Before we even begin the first session, we will sit down and thoroughly discuss your fitness goals.  Whether you are looking to improve body composition, lose some weight, put on some muscle, or increase overall health and vitality, we will come up with a training program unique to you to take you from where you are to where you want to be.  That being said we will demand 100% effort out of you every time you step foot in the facility here at CrossFit 704.  The only results you will get are those that you work for.  Effective training combined with proper diet and lifestyle habits will yield results you’ve never seen before.
