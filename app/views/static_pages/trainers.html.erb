  Fitness has always played a huge role in my life.  I played soccer growing up as well as track and field and lacrosse in high school.  In college I continued with the traditional weightlifting I did in high school to prepare for lacrosse, with mediocre and predictable results.  I trained and competed in triathlons up to the half-ironman distance and began climbing, snowboarding, and pursuing other adventures in the outdoors.  My brother introduced me to CrossFit in 2009.  I was instantly hooked, but was limited with commitments to an engineering degree, an internship, and as director of an outdoor adventure trip program.  After school I went full swing into CrossFit.  I truly enjoy coaching CrossFit and helping people reach their physical goals all while being part of a growing and vibrant community.  Being able to be a part of and witness transformation on a daily basis has truly been a blessing.

  For as long as I can remember, there hasn't been a moment in my life when I wasn't active.  Playing sports and living outdoors were just a way of life where I came from and I did it all; from playing organized sports like football to rolling around in the mud playing GI Joes with my buddies, I never stopped.  Joining the military seemed like the next logical step after graduating high school and it was during my time in the Marine Corps, 2007 to be exact, that I was introduced to Crossfit.  After leaving the military in 2009, I quickly realized that the void would need to be filled by any worthwhile training I could find.  My time soon became devoted to learning and eventually teaching multiple forms of martial arts.  While focusing on martial arts, I began to incorporate Crossfit back into my strength and conditioning and over time started to view Crossfit as a sport unto itself.  Fast forward a few years and teaching Crossfit is now my passion in life.  By focusing on the finer points of human movement and the foods that fuel our bodies, I hope to help others operate at their fullest athletic potential.
