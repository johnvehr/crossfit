  Fitness has always played a huge role in my life.  I played soccer growing up as well as track and field and lacrosse in high school.  In college I continued with the traditional weightlifting I did in high school to prepare for lacrosse, with mediocre and predictable results.  I trained and competed in triathlons up to the half-ironman distance and began climbing, snowboarding, and pursuing other adventures in the outdoors.  My brother introduced me to CrossFit in 2009.  I was instantly hooked, but was limited with commitments to an engineering degree, an internship, and as director of an outdoor adventure trip program.  After school I went full swing into CrossFit.  I truly enjoy coaching CrossFit and helping people reach their physical goals all while being part of a growing and vibrant community.  Being able to be a part of and witness transformation on a daily basis has truly been a blessing.
